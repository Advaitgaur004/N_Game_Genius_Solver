# N-Game Genius
This Project is for fun, as we have be learning DSA and want to apply some of the algorithm in quick way. `N-Game Genius` is a web-based tool designed to help users solve a classic mathematical puzzle where the goal is to make the number `N` using a set of numbers and basic arithmetic operations. It serves both educational and entertainment purposes, helping users sharpen their mathematical and problem-solving skills.

## How to Use

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/n-game-genius.git
```
### Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd n-game-genius
```

### View the Project:
Open <b>test.html</b> in your browser to interact with the N-Game Genius tool.
Open <b>about.html</b> to learn more about the project.

### Python Script:

You can run the algo.py script independently to solve the N-target problem programmatically.
Example usage:
python
Copy code
from algo import solve_n_target
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 16
print(solve_n_target(nums, target))  
#### Expected output: (5 * 4) - (3 + 1) = 16
